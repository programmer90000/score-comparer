This program accepts a text file containing multiple scores
The program removes all commas from the text file and replaces them with spaces
The program then adds a comma to the end of every line to turn it into a CSV file
All of the text before the first colon in the file is then removed
After this, the program creates an Array containing the two numbers of the score. The score must be seperated by a character
The program then compares each score and logs the final result to the table
Any lines which do not have 2 or 4 numbers will be displayed on the screen and can be counted manually.
